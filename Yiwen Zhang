### Welcome!
I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University. My advisor is [Dr. Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io).  My research interest is computational statistics.  I enjoy data analysis.  I find it entertaining to visualize complex datasets and bring intuition.  Telling stories behind datasets is fun.
