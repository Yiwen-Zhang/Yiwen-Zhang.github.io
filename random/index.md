## On The Road

I love [movies](http://movie.douban.com/mine?status=collect).  Grew up in an apartment with no cable, I was secretely satisfied that there was a free movie channel.  I watched a lot of plain old movies which were never the first choice for any kid.  The fact that there were no other choices helped me to sit through the whole movie.  Gradually, I start to grasp the beauty of this special way of telling a story. 

Other than movies, painting and reading also lighten my life.
