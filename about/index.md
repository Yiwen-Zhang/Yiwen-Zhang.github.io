title: About me
---

I am Yiwen Zhang.  I analyze data for fun, for fulfilling my passion, and for a living.  Recently graduated from North Carolina State University under the direction of [Dr. Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io/), I am getting ready for the next journey.  More information about my professional experiences can be found on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=80415510&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile_pic).  

I am a sensible person that many thoughts go through my mind and I want to put them down, for sharing and for clearing them up.
