What is data science? A buzzword with meanings as varied as butterflies.  If you flip through the job description of data scientists, they all require similar skill sets, and seemingly want the same group of people, but it is still unclear what exactly expected.  I'm fortunate enough to work in this area, and experienced the transition from statisticians to data scientists.  Recently graduated and will start to work as a data scientist soon, I decide to put down pieces of thoughts about this sexy job in an organized manor.  Hope my personal opinion of the constant battle between statisticians and computer scientists, and my personal experience of working as a data scientist, can be a little help if you want to work as a data scientist.  


By definition, data science is the union or intersection of statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge. Since I'm writing from the perspective of a statistician, I constantly ask myself is that any different from the old fasion statistician?  Conceptualy, this is not anything new.  The famous paper 'Future of data analysis' published 53 years ago by John Tukey, emphasized all three components.  Insights of the domain subject defines the direction of the whole analysis.  Theorys are important and are the very foundation of the data analysis.  But, they are limited.  The application of theories on convenient assumptions that neglect the imperfect reality of the subject may lead to mis-understanding.  Other than domain knowledge, computing is another aspect that Dr. Tukey tried hard to emphasize. He somestimes refer to it as practicality.  'If data analysis is to be helpful and useful, it must be practiced. '  Since the road map has been layed out half a century ago, is data science really an old gift in a new wrapper?  Based on my understanding, it is new, because every challenge we face on a daily basis is unique by nature.  They are still awaiting new methodologies, technologies, and smart people with the necessary skill set to resolve. It is a long way to go from acknowledging the challenge of computing to fully conquer this field.  

The concept of data science exists years ago, but a new rad name helpes a lot.  As human being, we can not escape from our human nature that we are drawn to the novelty.  Thanks to this name, data science draw a lot attention from the whole society.  In contrast to statistics, which has not changed for ages, buzzwords in computer science keeps popping up every few years, machine learning, data mining, neural network, deep learning, ....  This can be a very long list.  Interestingly, the word data science was proposed as early as 1998, by Dr. Jeff Wu, a professor in the statistics department at Michigan university in his inaugural speech.  However, we statisticians did not use it back then, and lost our chance to claim ownership to a great name. 



The battle between statisticians and computer scientists is still on going, and probably will not come to an recess in the foreseeable future.  They way I see it, is the constant struggle between the beautiful complex models and what can be practically implemented.  As Tukey mentioned before, practicality is an obstacle statisticians have to over come.  From the perspective of a statistician, this obstacle includs data manipulation and building stable robust models.  The tedious process of data cleaning and data organization is a crutial part of the job.  It is a conceptually easy job, but not that easy to get done correctly.  A lot of patients and meticulousness are required to guarantee our models are analyzing something that make sense.  I once read an arguement made by human resources bloggers that having data scientists spend tons of time organizating and manipulating the data is a waste.  I disagree.  Not only running the model need organized data the format of which only data scientists are familar of, but interesting insights of the problem comes from exploring the dataset.  Especially when the data is big and complex, some interesting and important facts and special cases might not come up without miticulous data organization.  Moreover, this is the area that statistics students need might show weakness comparing to computer science stuents, who have a good understanding of databases, and are proficient at massaging the data.  The next step, building stable and robust models should be of more fun.  However, to make it solid is not easy.  It is often the case that the data breaks the very assumption that the models are built upon.  If the model built gets run in a system over and over again using updated data, another challenge comes with corner cases and heterogeneity.  This is when the intuitive and practical methods proposed by computer scientists swoops in.  To work as a data scientist with a background in statistics, we need to have solid knowledge of statistical inference, modeling, and algorithmic knowledge, which serves the foundation for understanding in what cases models work or break.  On top of that, we need to get familar with the paractical tools in computer science that has been proven to be useful with massive emperical experiences.



In the job market, you may find two types of data scientist jobs, depending on how your analysis results are used.  The first type of data scientists produces results that talk to the machines.  A major employer is the online advertising industry.  The second kind of data scientists produces results that communicate to human beings.  Although the two types of data scientists sounds dramatically different, they require very similar skill sets, except the former emphasize solid coidng skills while the latter requires good interpersonal skills.  It is probably hard to identify which type it is based on the job description, but you will have a clear answer after the phone interview.  If your goal of life is to build a successful career, I believe the two types of data scientist jobs are merely two path that leads to the same destination.  To be an outstanding data scientist down on each path, the very foundation is the same, solid background knowledge, which can be acquired from course work, research experiences, and constant self learning.  To get the job, it is crucial to demonstrate the capability of connecting the messy massive data with the theories, and make use of both to solve the problems that concenrs the business.  This involve all three components of data science, statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge.  It is not easy to crunch the numbers, but your hard work and effort will eventually produce something insightful.  The next level which leads to success, is the interpersonal skills.  No matter which path you took at the beginning, the last level is always dealing with people.
