I am a little ashamed to admit that I consume many great literatures as well written entertaining stories, leaving me only the sketchy outline and a vague feeling.  I read _The Great Gatsby_ in Chinese and in English, and watched the movie.  The first time, the story to me was about the fancy early 20 century life style;  the second time, it was about a guy's obsess to his first love; when I watched the movie, it occur to me there is something more that I have trouble explicitly express.  _Fresh Air_ on NPR was talking about it the other day with a nice summary that I want to put down. 

<!-- It is a brutal story with three dead bodies by the end of the novel.  The Buchanan's leave town.  They leave other people to clean up their messes.  They are that kind of rich, privileged, entitled couple. And we've only got our narrator, Nick, who survives the wreck and lives on to tell us all the story of Gatsby, because he believed Gatsby has the one pure soul in the entire story. He's pure because he believes in something and his love for Daisy, even though she's married.  There must be moments that Daisy felt short for Gatsby's vision.  She is just something everybody is chasing, but she doesn't measure up.  -->

Gatsby is a dreamer who ties his dream to Daisy.  He can not escape the past, and he is pretending to be something he is not to achieve his self-transformation.  But, isn't it noble to try?  To be the boat against the current, even though you know failure and death inevitably await you.  The novel is about the doomed beauty of trying. Some think Gatsby's green light backens the thrivers. However, it is not as Gatsby dies.  Fitzgerald was not trying to bring this cheer-leading spring through Gatsby.  He celebrates the efforts, but he also lets us know there is a limit to it that ultimately we all reach the dead-end.  

Some say the ending of the novel is the greatest ending in American literature history.  

> Gatsby believed the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.  It eluded us then, but that's no matter -- tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther ... And one fine morning --

> So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly in to the past.
